VST SDK Installation Instructions
=================================

Please put the VST SDK files (v2.4) into this directory.

These files are NOT redistributed for legal reasons, but can be downloaded from the Steinberg web-site:
http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

After you have extracted the VST SDK files (v2.4), there should be *two* sub-directories inside the "vst_sdk" directory:
(1) "pluginterfaces"
(2) "public.sdk"

Note that VST v3.x is not currently used or supported, however the v3.x SDK also includes the required v2.4 files.
