Virtual Studio Technology (VST) SDK
===================================

Please put the VST SDK files (v2.4) into this directory. These files are NOT redistributed for legal reasons.

After you have extracted the VST SDK files (v2.4), there should be *two* sub-directories inside the "vst_sdk" directory:
(1) "pluginterfaces"
(2) "public.sdk"

The required SDK can be downloaded from the Steinberg Media Technologies web-site:
http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

Note that VST v3.x is not currently used or supported, but the v3.x SDK also includes the required v2.4 files.
