Dynamic Audio Normalizer
===============================================================================

**Dynamic Audio Normalizer** is a library and a command-line tool for *audio normalization*. It applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer *dynamically* adjusts the gain factor to the input audio. This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" parts of the audio while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" parts. In other words, the volume of the "quiet" and the "loud" parts will be harmonized.
